Marijuana as a legal, recreational drug across the nation may take some 
convincing. But, it shouldn't be that hard to convince communnities to 
support the medicinal use of marijuana, once they hear the benefits. 

An article from Business Insider, entitled, "23 Health benefits of 
marijuana," states some of the important reasons for legal pot use. 

Some of the health benefits are:
- it doesn't harm lung capacity
- it reduces chronic pain 
- helps glaucoma 
- helps control epileptic siezures 
- decreases anxiety 
- increases appetite 
- may slow progression of Alziemhers
- relieves arthitis discomfort 

Children, adults and elderly who are sick and suffering deserve medicine 
that works for their symptoms without all of the side effects that 
traditional medication often gives. The side effects of marijuana are not 
as harmful longterm. 

So, when asked why you support the legalization of marijuana, mention
all of these ways marijuana can help you. Marijuana has been proven to 
prevent diseases like cancer and Alziemher's from multiplying. Everyone 
can benefit from marijuana use. It should be avaliable and safely 
regulated for medicinal and recreational use.
