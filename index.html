<p>Who are we? 


We are a group of students who are passionate about the legalization and regulation of marijuana as a medicinal 
and recreational drug for people to safely use. Prohibition has halted the ability for doctors and patients to work together
and find the best treatment for that individual. It is vital that citizens of all ages are educated and actively working 
towards legislation changing for the better. On the website you can find important information, ways to get involved and
hear the stories of many whose lives were saved by marijuana.</p>
<p>Why are we?


It is important to advocate for the people who can not. People living with epilepsy, cancer, depression and anxiety,
Alziemhers and much more, aren't given many treatment options that work for them. We, as able bodied, healthy people, 
need to work with our legislators to create comprehensive marijuana reform for these people. Research shows that marijuana
helps encourage appetite, sleep and an overall more relaxed feeling. As a country, we are willing to give our sick opiods, 
but not marijuana, which has been a medicinal miracle for centuries around the planet.</p> 

<p>What now?

Read, engage, fact check and learn from this website! This site is your oyster! Enjoy.</p>
