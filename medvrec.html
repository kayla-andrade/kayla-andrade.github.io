<h1>Medical vs Recreational</h1>
<img src="websitebanner.jpg" width="1500" height="250"/>
Many people support the use of medicinal cannabis but not recreational uses. 
The question is why? 

It is interesting to compare the benefits and disadvantages of already 
legal substances such as alcohol and tabacco with marijuana. 

One sees that most of the disadvantages that pose serious and dangerous
threats all come from tabacco and alcohol use. A person could have never 
had a sip of alcohol in their life and die from their first alcohol experience
from alcohol poisioning. 

Deaths related strictly to use of marijuana are unheard of. But deaths related
strictly to the use of alcohol or tabacco products are astronomical. 

Marijuana use as a recreational drug should be monitored, safe and used 
in moderation (like all things). But it is important to acknowledge 
the hypocrisy of a community denying use of cannabis without denouncing 
the use of alcohol. 

Alcohol is exponentially more dangerous than marijuana. So why do we have 
this conversation of medical vs recreational? Marijuana should be as legal 
as alcohol is. No question 'bout it.
