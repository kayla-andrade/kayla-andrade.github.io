From 1906 onward, states across the United States have regulated, restricted 
or banned the use of marijuana. 

In 1906, many states labeled this drug as poisionous. And in 1920, 
prohibition was in full effect; making cannabis illegal in most states.
By the mid-1930's the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was implemented. 

Marijuana wasn't fully outlawed until the passage of the 1970 Controlled 
Substances Act. Which listed marijuana as a Schedule 1 Drug. This compares
pot to other drugs like fentanyl, heroin or cocaine. (Even though it is 
physically impossible to overdose from marijuana.) 

For many years the United States government heavily regulated marijuana 
use. Typically, racially profilling people of color. Many have said that 
the criminalization of marijuana has undoubtedly targeted minority groups.
For every white person that smokes pot today, 5 people of color are in 
jail for nonviolent, first offense marijuana offences. 

It is time that the United States right it's wrongs. Marijuana should have 
never been made illegal. The government misinformed the public by telling them
that this drug is poisionous, more dangerous than opiods. 

Many states have recently legalized marijuana and now recognize it as a 
recreational drug, such as alcohol (which is far more dangerous to humans 
anyway.) States like California, Colorado, Vermont, Massuchussets and more 
have passed legislation to protect the right to use cannabis and have 
seen major economic growth from taxation alone! Let's get pot out of 
politics and into the hands of the people already!!
